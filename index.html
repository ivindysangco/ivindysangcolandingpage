            <div class="bio-content">
                <p>What happens when a Naval Flight Officer becomes a Technical Product Manager? You get someone who understands both what operational users need in high stakes environments and how to build it.</p>

                <p>I operated advanced airborne early warning systems aboard the E-2C/D Hawkeye, a specialized aircraft that detects threats and coordinates tactical responses in real time, where system reliability isn't optional, it's survival. As an Air Operations Officer for the US Navy's 7th Fleet (Western Pacific), I coordinated complex operations across a region larger than North America, managing the integration of multiple data sources and systems where split-second decisions matter.</p>

                <p>After transitioning from the Navy, I brought this mission focused mindset to Capital One as a Technical Product Manager. Working with software engineers, I built backend systems that detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real time, another domain where milliseconds matter and failure isn't acceptable.</p>

                <p>Armed with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from the US Naval Academy and an MBA from New York University Stern, I specialize in translating operational challenges into technical solutions. My unique combination of operational experience and technical product management expertise enables me to build systems where reliability, performance, and mission success are essential.</p>
