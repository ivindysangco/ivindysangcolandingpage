## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting the comma
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Missing comma
{
    title: "Recipe 1"
}
{
    title: "Recipe 2"
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Has comma
{
    title: "Recipe 1"
},
{
    title: "Recipe 2"
}
```

### 2. Breaking the quotes
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Quote inside quote breaks it
description: "It's amazing"

// ✅ CORRECT - Escape the quote or use different quotes
description: "It's amazing"  // or
description: 'It\'s amazing'
```

### 3. Wrong array order for updates
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Old updates at top
updates: [
    { date: "October 2025", ... },
    { date: "November 2025", ... }  // Newer but at bottom
]

// ✅ CORRECT - Newest at top
updates: [
    { date: "November 2025", ... },  // Newest at top
    { date: "October 2025", ... }
]
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Content not showing?

1. **Check browser console** (Press F12, look for errors)
2. **Check your commas** - Most common issue!
3. **Make sure quotes match** - Every opening quote needs a closing quote
4. **Refresh with cache clear** - Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

### Need to undo changes?

The original content is backed up in:
- `culinary-updates-plan.md`
- `personalblog.md`
