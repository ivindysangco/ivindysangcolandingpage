## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting Commas
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
{
    title: "Recipe 1"
}
{
    title: "Recipe 2"
}

// ✅ CORRECT
{
    title: "Recipe 1"
},
{
    title: "Recipe 2"
}
```

### 2. Quotes Inside Quotes
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
description: "It's amazing"

// ✅ CORRECT
description: "It's amazing"
// or
description: 'It\'s amazing'
```

### 3. Wrong Order for Updates
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Oldest at top
updates: [
    { date: "October 2025", ... },
    { date: "November 2025", ... }
]

// ✅ CORRECT - Newest at top
updates: [
    { date: "November 2025", ... },  // Newest first
    { date: "October 2025", ... }
]
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Content Not Showing?

1. **Check browser console** - Press F12, look for errors
2. **Check your commas** - Most common issue!
3. **Check quotes match** - Every `"` needs a closing `"`

### Image Not Showing?

1. **Check file path** - Exact match, case-sensitive
2. **Check file exists** - Navigate to folder and verify
3. **Hard refresh browser**
4. See `IMAGE-STRATEGY.md` for more help
