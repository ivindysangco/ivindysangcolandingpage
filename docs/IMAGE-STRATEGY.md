## 📝 How to Add Images to Content

### Option 1: Add Image to Existing Entry

## 🎨 When to Use Images vs. Gradients

### Use Images When:
- ✅ You have high-quality photos
- ✅ The visual adds value (shows the actual dish/place/watch)
- ✅ You want a more personal touch
- ✅ The image tells a story

### Use Gradients When:
- ✅ You don't have photos yet (coming soon)
- ✅ Maintaining consistent aesthetic
- ✅ Faster page load times
- ✅ Clean, minimalist look

### Pro Tip: Mix Both!
Use gradients as placeholders, then add photos over time. The system supports both simultaneously - some cards can have images, others can have gradients.

## 📸 Photography Tips

### For Culinary Photos:

**Good Lighting:**
- Natural light from a window is best
- Shoot during daytime
- Avoid harsh overhead lights
- Use a white reflector (foam board) to bounce light

**Composition:**
- Shoot from 45° angle (not straight down)
- Fill the frame with the dish
- Simple, clean background
- Add props sparingly (utensils, ingredients)

**Camera Settings:**
- Use portrait mode for blurred background
- Tap to focus on the main subject
- Increase exposure slightly (+0.5 to +1.0)

### For Travel Photos:

**Destination Cards:**
- Use wide shots that show the essence of the place
- Include landmarks or defining features
- Capture during golden hour (sunset/sunrise)
- Avoid tourist crowds if possible

**Storytelling:**
- Mix landscape and detail shots
- Include people for scale and context
- Capture local life and culture
- Show unique perspectives

### For Watch Photos:

**Lighting is Critical:**
- Use soft, diffused light (near window with curtain)
- Avoid direct sunlight (causes harsh shadows)
- Use a white surface for even light reflection

**Composition:**
- Shoot straight on or 45° angle
- Use macro mode for dial details
- Clean the watch thoroughly (no dust/fingerprints)
- Simple background (white or dark gray)

**Specific Shots:**
- **Hero:** Full watch on wrist or laid flat
- **Dial:** Close-up showing markers and hands
- **Movement:** Through caseback if available
- **Wrist Shot:** Wearing it in natural setting

## 🚀 Quick Workflow

### Adding Your First Image (5 minutes):

1. **Choose your best photo**
2. **Optimize it:**
   - Go to https://tinypng.com
   - Upload your image
   - Download compressed version
3. **Save to correct folder:**
   - `/images/culinary/[recipe-name]/hero.jpg`
   - `/images/travel/[location-name]/hero.jpg`
   - `/images/horology/[brand-model]/hero.jpg`
4. **Update data file:**
   - Change `image: null` to `image: "images/[section]/[name]/hero.jpg"`
5. **Save and refresh browser**
6. **Done!** Your image now appears on the card

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Compress images before uploading
- ✅ Use descriptive file names (`ramen-hero.jpg`, not `IMG_1234.jpg`)
- ✅ Keep original high-res photos backed up elsewhere
- ✅ Test on mobile after adding images
- ✅ Use consistent aspect ratios within each section
- ✅ Add alt text for accessibility (future enhancement)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Upload massive (5MB+) uncompressed images
- ❌ Use spaces in filenames (use hyphens instead)
- ❌ Mix different aspect ratios in same section
- ❌ Upload copyrighted images without permission
- ❌ Forget to test how images look on cards

## 🔄 Updating/Replacing Images

To replace an image:
1. Navigate to the image folder
2. Delete or rename the old image
3. Save new image with same filename
4. Refresh browser (may need hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R)
5. Done! No code changes needed

---

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

Your images automatically scale on mobile, but keep these in mind:

- **File size matters more on mobile** (slower connections)
- **Test on your phone** after adding images
- **Portrait orientation** works better for mobile
- **Text should be legible** even when image is small

---

## 🌐 Advanced: Responsive Images (Future Enhancement)

For even better performance, you can add multiple image sizes:

```javascript
{
    title: "Recipe Name",
    images: {
        mobile: "images/culinary/recipe-mobile.jpg",
        tablet: "images/culinary/recipe-tablet.jpg",
        desktop: "images/culinary/recipe-desktop.jpg"
    }
}
```

(This requires template updates - ask if you want to implement this later)

## 🎨 Image Editing Recommendations

### Free Tools:
- **GIMP** (Desktop - like Photoshop but free)
- **Photopea** (Web - https://www.photopea.com)
- **Canva** (Web - great for adding text/graphics)
- **Pixlr** (Web - quick edits)

### Paid Tools:
- **Adobe Lightroom** ($10/mo - best for photography)
- **Affinity Photo** ($70 one-time - like Photoshop)

### Quick Edits:
- **Brightness/Contrast:** Make images pop
- **Saturation:** Boost colors slightly (+10 to +20%)
- **Crop:** Focus on main subject
- **Sharpen:** Add clarity (but don't overdo it)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Image Not Showing?

1. **Check file path** - Is it exactly `images/section/name/hero.jpg`?
2. **Check filename** - Case-sensitive! `Hero.jpg` ≠ `hero.jpg`
3. **Check file exists** - Navigate to folder and verify
4. **Hard refresh browser** - Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
5. **Check browser console** - Press F12, look for 404 errors

### Image Too Large/Slow?

1. **Compress it** - Use TinyPNG or Squoosh
2. **Resize it** - No need for images larger than 1920px wide
3. **Check file size** - Should be under 200KB for cards

### Image Looks Distorted?

1. **Check aspect ratio** - Should be 4:3 or 16:9
2. **Crop to correct ratio** before uploading
3. **Don't stretch** - Maintain original proportions
